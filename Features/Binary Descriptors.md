# How binary features are made?
1. The image is divided into blocks
2. Blocks are being compared
3. Comparison result is written in binary format
4. One could use hamming distance to compare features
	 ==Do we have _popcnt_ instruction?==

Binary descriptors allow to do a very fast match check!
They are also quite fast to construct.
